The consequences of the earthquake were felt throughout the region of Grand Est. At 13 September 2022, 2068 témoignages were collected by the BCSF, allowing for the establishment of a map of seismic intensities that reached a maximum of IV, corresponding to a perception of moderate intensity and no damage to buildings.;IRSN Fiche seisme MULHOUSE 13092022.pdf & Note-Information-Seisme-Teil-14112019.pdf;"The given context information does not provide any direct information about the link between the Mulhouse earthquake and the tectonics of the Rhine Fossa. However, it does mention that the earthquake occurred at 14 km southeast of Mulhouse and 15 km north of Basel, with a localization according to the RENASS (Réseau national d'études sismiques). The RENASS is a French network that studies seismic activity and its potential impact on the environment and human activities.

As for the future activity in the region, the context information mentions that the Bureau d'évaluation des risques sismiques pour la sûreté des installations (BERSSIN) of the IRSN (Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire) conducts research and expertises on the seismic risk as an external hazard for nuclear installations. However, it does not provide any specific information on the future activity in the region.

It is worth noting that the Rhine Fossa is a major tectonic fault that runs through Switzerland, France, and Germany. It is considered one of the most active tectonic faults in Europe, with a history of frequent earthquakes. The last major earthquake on the Rhine Fossa occurred in 1986 in the Swiss town of Aigle, with a magnitude of 6.1. Since then, there have been several smaller earthquakes in the region.

In summary, while the given context information does not provide specific information on the link between the Mulhouse earthquake and the tectonics of the Rhine Fossa, it does mention that the earthquake occurred in the region of the Rhine Fossa and that the BERSSIN conducts research on seismic risk as an external hazard for nuclear installations.

IRSN_seisme_france-26022012_V2.pdf;The earthquake that occurred on February 26, 2012, in Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye, France, was a moderate earthquake with a magnitude of 4.8 (Ml - CEA). The earthquake was felt widely by the population in the south-east of France and in the Piedmont region of Italy. The most intense seismic activity was recorded at V (seismic intensity) on the Beaufort scale, which indicates that the earthquake was strongly felt and caused slight damage to buildings. The earthquake was caused by a fault slip mechanism, which is common in this region of the Alps. The region of Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye has experienced several earthquakes in the past, including a strong earthquake in 1959 with an intensity of VII-VIII on the Beaufort scale and a magnitude of approximately 5.

However, the Algeria had not experienced any major earthquakes until the 21 May 2003 earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.7 and caused significant damage.

The context information also indicates that the Algeria has only research nuclear reactors of low power, and the closest nuclear power plants are located in Spain, 530 kilometers away from the epicenter of the earthquake. Therefore, it is not expected that the earthquake will have any notable effects on the nuclear power plants.

The context information also mentions that the Algeria has a moderate sismic activity compared to other regions of the country, and the intensity of the earthquake was evaluated to be less than V. However, the intensity of the earthquake is expected to be higher than VIII, and a more precise evaluation can only be done after on-site investigation.

The context information also mentions that the earthquake occurred in a region where the activity was considered moderate, and a major fault of the order of several tens of kilometers was activated. This fault is not cartographied, which means that it is not known exactly where it is located.

irsn_Seisme-Inde_012001.pdf;"The earthquake in Gurajat, India, on January 26, 2001, was a superficial earthquake that occurred on a fault that was not known to be active in the recent past. The earthquake created a rupture on the surface with a centimeter displacement. The trace of this rupture was quickly detected using satellite data, and the geologists were able to measure the deformations on the ground. The earthquake was the first in France to use satellite data for this purpose.

The earthquakes in France typically occur between 5 and 20 kilometers deep. However, the earthquake in Gurajat was very superficial. It is worth noting that in the region of Tricastin, the seismic activity known in the past has also occurred at shallow depths. This superficial seismic activity appears to be a characteristic of this region.

The earthquake in Gurajat presented characteristics similar to the strongest historical earthquakes in the region. The magnitude of moment (Mw) estimated from seismological records was confirmed by analyzing the dimensions of the rupture that caused the earthquake, including length, width, and displacement, using satellite data. It is necessary to further characterize and potentially retain this information for defining the seismic risk for nuclear power plants in Tricastin and Cruas.

The plant has three boiling water reactors, TOSHIBA, of respective powers of 525, 825, and 825 MWe. At the time of the earthquake, only one reactor was in operation (source: Asahi Shinbun). According to the JMA, the intensity 6-7 (on the Japanese scale JMA-7) was reached in the epicenter and in the region of the Onagawa site. The intensities JMA are calculated based on the acceleration of the ground, and the strong values of acceleration (> 0.5 g) deduced from the first measurements (on May 26) of the intensity map were confirmed by subsequent measurements of ground acceleration from May 27, 2003. The intensity 6-7 of the JMA scale corresponds to the intensity IX-X of the Mercalli MSK scale (Kramer S. L., Geotechnical earthquake engineering - Eds Prentice, Hall International series, 1996) used to characterize the seismic activity in France. Such levels of intensity cause widespread damage to ancient French buildings vulnerable to seismic activity. The Japanese construction parasismic measures seem to have prevented damage and saved human lives. The design of nuclear power plants in Japan is based on two levels of acceleration of probability of occurrence different. For the Onagawa site, the first level (0.25 g) is probable during the lifetime of the installation; the second level (0.375 g) has a very low probability of being reached (source: Uranium Information Centre). According to the French embassy in Japan, the ground acceleration recorded at the Onagawa site was 0.225 g. The threshold of 0.2 g was exceeded, the automatic safety procedures were triggered by the seismic activity, and the plant was shut down, in accordance with the safety procedures in Japan.

The seismic event of September 19, 2012, was one of the many seismic events that have occurred in the region in the past.

The PACA region is known to be one of the most seismically active regions in France. The region has experienced several seismic events of varying magnitudes in the past, including the 1887 earthquake in Ligure and the 1909 earthquake in Lambesc. The region is also known for its regular but low-level seismic activity, which is primarily concentrated in the arrière-pays niçois and along an axis that runs from the aixoise region to the confines of the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence region and extends to the region of La Motte-du-Caire. The FMD, or the ""Fault of the Middle Durance,"" is the name given to this fault by geologists.

The IRSN, the French national agency responsible for evaluating the risks associated with seismic activity, has been conducting research and expertises on the FMD since the beginning of the 1990s. These studies have helped to create a cartography of the fault in both its surface and subsurface features and have provided insights into how the fault produces deformations. The studies have concluded that the FMD has the potential to produce very large but rare seismic events with a recurrence period of several thousand years. The studies have also identified traces of ancient seismic events (paleoseismic events) that could have reached or exceeded the magnitudes of the Lambesc and Ligure earthquakes.";IRSN-Seisme-Manosque-19092012.pdf & IRSN-Seisme-Manosque-19092012.pdf;The Faille de la Moyenne Durance (FMD) is a fault in the Alps de Haute-Provence region of France. The fault is responsible for the 2012 earthquake in Villeneuve, which was of magnitude 3.5 (Ml). The FMD is a regular but low-level seismic activity, with most of the earthquakes being of low magnitude. However, the FMD has a history of producing stronger earthquakes in the past, such as in 1509 and 1708, which caused damage to buildings. The FMD is also responsible for the 11 June 1909 earthquake in Lambesc, which was of magnitude 6. The FMD is a fault that runs along the Ardèche region of France. The fault is active and has produced several earthquakes in the past, including the 2012 earthquake in Villeneuve. The FMD is a major seismic hazard in the region and is being studied by the IRSN to better understand its behavior and potential for future earthquakes.;IRSN-Seisme-Manosque-19092012.pdf & Note-Information-Seisme-Teil-14112019.pdf
IRSN-Seisme-Napa-24082014.pdf;The magnitude of the earthquake that occurred in Napa, California on August 24, 2014 was 6.0. The earthquake was felt as far away as Chico, which is approximately 170 km to the north, and Fresno, which is approximately 280 km to the south. The earthquake caused significant damage to buildings in Napa and Vallejo, including three historic buildings. It also caused a fire that destroyed six houses and damaged the water supply and electrical systems. The earthquake was the most significant in the region since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.9 and occurred on the San Andreas fault in the south of San Francisco Bay.;IRSN-Seisme-Napa-24082014.pdf & IRSN-Seisme-LaRochelle-28042016.pdf;"The earthquake of Napa occurred on August 24, 2014, at 10:24 TU, with a magnitude of 6.0. The epicenter of the earthquake was located between two major fault systems, the San Andreas fault and the Hayward-Rodgers Creek fault, in California, USA. The San Andreas fault is a major fault that runs along the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, with a rate of approximately 3 cm/an. The Hayward-Rodgers Creek fault is another major fault that runs parallel to the San Andreas fault, with a rate of approximately 3 cm/an. The earthquake caused significant damage to the region, with the epicenter located approximately 2 km from a fault called the ""West Napa"" fault. The ""West Napa"" fault is a relatively poorly characterized fault with a tectonic deformation rate of between 0.2 and 1.0 mm/an, which is significantly lower than the rate of the major faults in the region. The earthquake caused significant damage to the region, with the epicenter located approximately 2 km from a fault called the ""West Napa"" fault.

IRSN-Seisme-Norcia-Italie-301016_V1.pdf;"The magnitude of the earthquake that occurred in Italy on October 30, 2016, is 6.5. The earthquake was located approximately 9 km below the surface and occurred at a latitude of 42.70° North and a longitude of 13.24° East. The earthquake was preceded by two significant earthquakes on October 26, 2016, with magnitudes of 5.4 and 5.9, respectively. The total number of earthquakes of magnitude greater than 3 that have been felt in the region since August 24, 2016, is over 700.

The Commissione Nazionale per i Rischi Majori (National Commission for Major Risks) of Italy had previously noted that the occurrence of a new major event in the region could not be excluded. The earthquake caused significant damage to cultural heritage in the region, particularly to the medieval towns of Visso, Ussita, and Castelluccio Fiorita, and caused the collapse of the Abbazia di San Paolo fuori le Mura (Abbacy of St. Paul Outside the Walls) in Rome. The earthquake was felt as far as 100 km from the epicenter.";IRSN-Seisme-Norcia-Italie-301016_V1.pdf & IRSN-Seisme-Amatrice-Italie-240816_V1.pdf;The context information provides details about a sequence of earthquakes that occurred in Italy in 2016. The earthquakes were caused by the rupture of a fault system in the Apennines, which is known to be a high-risk area for earthquakes. The sequence of earthquakes caused significant damage to cultural heritage sites in the region. The experience gained from studying the ruptures of surface produced by the earthquakes is important for understanding the relationships between the magnitude of earthquakes and the dimension of surface ruptures. This knowledge is important for characterizing the faults that have generated strong earthquakes in the past, including in France. The study of the relationships between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture dimensions is important for evaluating the seismic risk in other regions, including France, where earthquakes are relatively rare.;IRSN-Seisme-Norcia-Italie-301016_V1.pdf & IRSN-Seisme-Amatrice-Italie-240816_V1.pdf
IRSN-Seisme-Vendee-France-20180212.pdf;The earthquake of Saint-Hilaire-de-Voust in 2018 occurred on February 12th, 2018 at 3h08 TU. The magnitude of the earthquake was 4.8 according to the Ml1 scale of the CEA. The damage reported includes some light damage to buildings, with some people being awakened and some objects falling. The earthquake was also accompanied by an audible sound wave that was heard up to 20 kilometers away from the epicenter.;IRSN-Seisme-Vendee-France-20180212.pdf & IRSN-Seisme-Vendee-France-20180212.pdf;"The impact of the 2018 Saint-Hilaire-de-Voust earthquake on nuclear power plants was assessed. The earthquake occurred on February 12th, 2018, and had a magnitude of 4.8. The most significant earthquake in the region occurred on January 25th, 1799, with an intensity of VII-VIII and a magnitude of more than 6. The earthquake of 2018 was the strongest earthquake felt in the region since 1972. The earthquakes in the region occur on faults oriented NO-SE to NNO-SSE inherited from the Armorican massif, which was formed 300 million years ago and reactivated since.

The nuclear power plants closest to the Saint-Hilaire-de-Voust earthquake are the Pouzauges nuclear power plant, the Chinon nuclear power plant, and the Civaux nuclear power plant, located respectively 20 km, 85 km, and 100 km from the epicenter. The Pouzauges nuclear power plant was at an automatic shutdown at the time of the earthquake, and the sources of irradiation were in a safe position in the storage pond. No notable impact was reported on the other nuclear power plants mentioned. The niveaux de sollicitation to be taken into account for these installations are defined in a specific technical regulation (RFS 2001-01). This regulation requires defining zones (dites zones sismotectoniques) considered homogeneous from the point of view of their potential to generate seismes, then recensering the most important seismes historiquement connus sur chacune de ces zones. The sollicitation sismique retenue is then defined by assuming that the seismes identifiés can occur in the future in any point of the zone sismotectonique to which they belong and by majoring the magnitude of these seismes by 0.5 and their intensity by 1. The alea sismique retenu selon cette démarche pour les installations nucléaires de Pouzauges, Civaux et Chinon est notablement plus élevé que la sollicitation sismique observée lors du séisme du 12/02/2018.";Note-Information-Seisme-Teil-14112019.pdf & IRSN-Seisme-Vendee-France-20180212.pdf
