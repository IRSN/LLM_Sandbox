IRSN Fiche seisme MULHOUSE 13092022.pdf;The magnitude of the earthquake that occurred on September 10, 2022 near Mulhouse and Bâle is 3.9 (Mw - Géoazur). The localization of the earthquake is 7.471° E. The consequences of the earthquake were felt throughout the region of Grand Est, with a maximum intensity of IV on the local scale, corresponding to a perception that was moderately felt by humans and caused no damage to buildings.;IRSN Fiche seisme MULHOUSE 13092022.pdf & IRSN-Seisme-Manosque-19092012.pdf;"The 2022 Basel earthquake is related to the tectonics of the Fossé Rhénan, which is a rift system that has been forming for approximately 40 million years. The Fossé Rhénan is characterized by a system of faults oriented primarily in the NNE-SSO direction, with several faults presenting markers of recent activity (quaternary). The mechanism of the earthquake's origin determined for the 2022 Basel earthquake indicates a pure decrochant earthquake in agreement with the regional context and the past seismic activity, including the 1980 Sierentz earthquake. The Sierentz earthquake, of magnitude local 4.7, was located approximately 4 km from the epicenter of the 2022 earthquake and produced several hundred aftershocks in the 16 days following the main shock. To date, a few significant aftershocks have been recorded following the 2022 earthquake, and the activity may continue in the days to come. The precise location of these aftershocks could contribute to identifying the active structures in the region.

The region of Basel is marked by a recurrent sismic activity, which includes several earthquakes of intensity greater than V, the most important being the Basel earthquakes. The 2022 Basel earthquake and the Fossé Rhénan seismic activity are related, as the Fossé Rhénan is a major contributor to the seismic activity in the region. The geodynamic context of the Fossé Rhénan seismic activity is related to the 2022 Basel earthquake, as the earthquake was a pure decrochant earthquake in agreement with the regional context and the past seismic activity.

As for the future activity sismique in the region, the aftershocks following the 2022 earthquake suggest that the activity may continue in the days to come. However, it is important to note that predicting the future activity sismique with precision is difficult, and more information is needed to make accurate predictions.";IRSN Fiche seisme MULHOUSE 13092022.pdf & IRSN Fiche seisme MULHOUSE 13092022.pdf
IRSN_Fiche-Seisme-Maroc.pdf;The earthquake that occurred in Morocco on September 8, 2023, had a magnitude of 6.8, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The estimated depth of the earthquake's foyer is 11.6 km, as reported by the Centre Sismologique Euro-Méditerranéen (CSEM), and 26 km, as reported by the USGS. The earthquake was located 70 km southwest of Marrakech, and it was followed by 20 aftershocks with magnitudes ranging from 2.2 to 4.8. The earthquake caused significant damage in the epicentral region, with numerous building collapses and casualties. The impact of the earthquake was felt on a vast region that extended to Algeria, Spain, and Portugal, as reported by the CSEM.;IRSN-Seisme-Manosque-19092012.pdf & IRSN_Fiche-Seisme-Maroc.pdf;"The 6.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred in Morocco on September 8, 2023, is situated within the context of the country's sismotectonic activity. The earthquake occurred in the Rif and Alboran Sea region, which is characterized by a high level of seismic activity due to the presence of the Nubia-Eurasia Plate Boundary Zone. This region is also known for its high seismic hazards, which are a result of the complex interactions between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate.

The impact of the earthquake on the nuclear power production in Morocco is not yet clear, as the IRSN does not have any information on the potential effects of the earthquake on the country's nuclear power plants. However, the development of a nuclear power program in Morocco is being considered, with the site of Sidi Boulbra being evaluated for the construction of a nuclear power plant. The site is located on the coast between Safi and Essaouira, approximately 135 km from the epicenter of the earthquake.

In terms of the impact on the research reactor in Morocco, the IRSN has not yet released any information on the potential effects of the earthquake on the installation. However, the Bureau d'évaluation des risques sismiques pour la sûreté des installations (BERSSIN) is responsible for assessing the seismic hazards for industrial installations in Morocco. The BERSSIN uses various methods, including the analysis of seismic data and the distribution of macro-seismic intensities, to evaluate the risk of seismic hazards for industrial installations in the country.";IRSN_Fiche-Seisme-Maroc.pdf & IRSN_Fiche-Seisme-Maroc.pdf

IRSN_seisme_Christchurch-NZ_23022011.pdf;The impact of the Christchurch earthquake that occurred on February 21, 2011, was significantly more devastating than that of the September 2010 earthquake in New Zealand. The 2011 earthquake resulted in 75 deaths and 300 missing people, while the 2010 earthquake resulted in no fatalities. The 2011 earthquake was also more powerful, with a magnitude of 6.3, compared to the 2010 earthquake's magnitude of 7.1. However, the 2011 earthquake's impact was more severe due to its proximity to urbanized areas, resulting in significant damage to infrastructure and human life. In contrast, the 2010 earthquake's impact was less severe due to its location away from urbanized areas.;IRSN_seisme_Christchurch-NZ_23022011.pdf & IRSN_seisme_Christchurch-NZ_23022011.pdf;There are no nuclear power plants in New Zealand. The GreenDale Fault is a 80 km long, decrochant (horizontal sliding) fault that is situated mostly to the west of Christchurch, New Zealand. It is a regular seismic activity site with over 4000 recorded replicas since September 2010. The GreenDale Fault is a transform fault that is oblique to the Alpine Fault, a major fault in New Zealand's tectonic activity. The GreenDale Fault is a satellite fault to the Alpine Fault. The recent earthquake that occurred on February 21, 2011, was a strong replica that occurred on the eastern termination of the GreenDale Fault. The mechanism of the earthquake was a segment of the faille inverse (deformation in raccourcissement) that produced a vertical coulissage.;IRSN_seisme_Christchurch-NZ_23022011.pdf & IRSN_seisme_Christchurch-NZ_23022011.pdf
IRSN_seisme_france-26022012_V2.pdf;"The earthquake that occurred on February 26, 2012 in the Hautes-Alpes region of France was a moderate earthquake with a magnitude between 4.3 and 4.8, according to the institutions. It occurred at a location of 44°30’ North and 06°42’ East, and its depth was estimated to be approximately 6 km. The earthquake was felt by the population of the South-East of France and the region of Piedmont in Italy. The intensities collected by the BCSF at this time (www.franceseisme.fr) reached V (seismic intensity strongly felt - slight damage on vulnerable buildings). Several aftershocks of low magnitude have already been recorded, with the most important occurring on February 27, 2012 at 17h31 local time, with a magnitude of 4. According to the Sismalp network, a slight seismic activity was recorded in the epicentral area a few days before the main shock. The earthquake of February 26, 2012 is associated with a mechanism called ""en faille normale à composante décrochante"" (INGV - USGS), which is typical of this region of the Alps. The region of Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye has experienced several seismic episodes in the past, with the most severe occurring on April 5, 1959, with an intensity of VII-VIII (www.sisfrance.net) and a magnitude of approximately 5.";IRSN_seisme_france-26022012_V2.pdf & IRSN_seisme_france-26022012_V2.pdf;The sismic activity in the Ubaye Valley and Haiti, including the historical and current seismic activity, as well as the spatial and mechanical aspects of the 2012 Haiti earthquake, is linked to the 26 February 2012 earthquake in several ways. Firstly, the 26 February 2012 earthquake occurred in a region with a history of seismic activity, and it was one of the most damaging earthquakes in the area. Secondly, the 2003-2004 sismic swarm, which was an important seismic activity in the area, was also linked to the 26 February 2012 earthquake as it was located in the same region. The 2003-2004 sismic swarm was also used to study the characteristics of the 1959 earthquake, which was the most damaging earthquake in the area. Finally, the 26 February 2012 earthquake was located in the same region as the 2003-2004 sismic swarm, and the first determinations of the movement on the fault (mechanism at the source) seem to be compatible with the movements determined during the 2003-2004 sismic swarm.;IRSN_seisme_france-26022012_V2.pdf & IRSN_seisme_france-26022012_V2.pdf

irsn_seisme_niigata_japon_092007.pdf;Japan is located at the point of convergence of three tectonic plates: the Philippine Plate, the Pacific Plate, and the Eurasian Plate. This convergence results in a strong seismic activity primarily in the zones of subduction along the coasts at significant depths (typically between 30 and 150 km). Additionally, there are numerous active intracontinental faults in Japan, which produce sismic activity of lesser magnitude but at shallower depths (10-15 km). The 2007 Chu-Etsu-Oki earthquake, which occurred on the coast of Japan, was localized in the zone of transition between the active fault system of Itoigawa-Shizuoka and the convergence zone of the Japan Sea. This earthquake allowed for the accommodation of a portion of the deformation resulting from the convergence, as did the 2004 Niigata Ken-Chu-Etsu earthquake, which occurred less than 50 kilometers away. Geophysical surveys are planned to be conducted by the end of the year to better characterize the geometry of the active fault system during the 2007 earthquake and to examine the possibility of an active fault emerging on the site of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant.;irsn_seisme_niigata_japon_092007.pdf & IRSN_seisme-Manosque_V1-12072010.pdf;The provided context information does not mention any information about the consequences of the 2019 Blayais Earthquake in terms of human casualties.

The historical background of earthquakes in Manosque shows that the city has experienced significant damages due to earthquakes in the past. The 2010 Manosque Earthquake was felt by the population in different locations and caused significant damages. The magnitude and location of the earthquake were different according to different sources. The secousse, which did not cause any damages, was strongly felt by the population in Manosque and Pierrevert, but not significantly in other locations. The Ville de Manosque has experienced two remarkable earthquakes in the past, in 1509 and 1708, which caused significant damages to constructions and are recorded in the base de sismicité historique with an intensity of VIII in Manosque. The intensity corresponds to an evaluation of the importance of the seismic event in a given location in terms of effects (perception, effects on objects, and damages to constructions).
